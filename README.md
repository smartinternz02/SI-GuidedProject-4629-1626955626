## Digital Naturalist using IBM Cloud
A naturalist is someone who studies the patterns of nature, identifies a different kind of flora and fauna in nature. Being able to identify the flora and fauna around us often leads to an interest in protecting wild spaces, and collecting and sharing information about the species we see.

This project focuses on detection of different species of birds,flowers and mammals and obtaining images of that particular category (birds,flowers,mammals) when an image is given.
